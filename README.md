# Dashcam Car RPI
As my parents encounter many dangers on road, I decided to create a custom Dashcam for their car.
I'm going to write all my researchs here, and later put the code.

## Components
### Board
I'm picking the **Raspberry PI Zero 1.3** on Aliexpress, it has an CSI interface.

**Price :** 9.13€ (with Aliexpress welcome offer)

### Camera
I found a pretty **OV5647** on Aliexpress, I will use it.

**Price :** 3.64€

### Camera cable
But, to adapt it from 15pin to the 22pin of the RPI0, I'm gonna use **another cable**, bought on [Go Tronic](https://www.gotronic.fr/art-nappe-camera-pour-pi-zero-rb0-cam-15-33987.htm).

**Prince :** 2.40€

### Storage
I'm using an SanDisk 64Gb micro SD card.

**Price :** 4.11€
