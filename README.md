# Dashcam Car RPI
As my parents encounter many dangers on road, I decided to create a custom Dashcam for their car.
I'm going to write all my researchs here, and later put the code.

## Components
### Board
I'm picking the Raspberry PI 0W on [Aliexpress](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005004339923548.html), it has an CSI interface.

**Price :** 9.13€ (with Aliexpress welcome offer)

### Camera
I found this pretty [OV5647](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005006064966176.html) on Aliexpress, I will use it.

**Price :** 3.64€

### Camera cable
But, to adapt it from 15pin to the 22pin of the RPI0W, I'm gonna use another cable, bought on [Go Tronic](https://www.gotronic.fr/art-nappe-camera-pour-pi-zero-rb0-cam-15-33987.htm).

**Prince :** 2.40€

### Storage
I'm using an [SanDisk 64Gb](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005006572226710) micro SD card.

**Price :** 4.11€

### Total Price
The total price come up to 19.20€
